# DevConnector
DevConnector is a social networking platform designed specifically for developers.

Think of it as a hybrid between LinkedIn and GitHub's social features. Its core purpose is to allow developers to:

Create a professional profile.

Showcase their skills, projects, and experience.

Connect with other developers.

Share posts and engage with content (like discussions or news).
